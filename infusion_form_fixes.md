**All issues have been resolved and tested successfully:**
- ✅ Duplicate previous diagnoses loading - FIXED

- ✅ Strength and Route fields not saving - FIXED

**Last tested:** August 7, 2025 - All functionality working as expected

## Issue: Strength and Route Fields Not Saving

**Problem:** The "Strength" and "Route" fields in the enhanced infusion form were not saving to the database, showing only placeholder text.

**Root Cause:** The `save_enhanced.php` file was missing the `order_strength` and `order_route` fields in the form data preparation.

**Solution:** Added the missing fields to the form data array in the save handler.

### Files Modified:
- `/var/www/emr.carepointinfusion.com/interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-inventory/integration/save_enhanced.php`

### Changes Made:
**Added to form data preparation:**
```php
'order_strength' => $_POST['order_strength'] ?? null,
'order_route' => $_POST['order_route'] ?? null,
```

### Database Fields:
- `order_strength` - varchar(255) - Stores medication strength (e.g., "1000 mg")
- `order_route` - varchar(255) - Stores administration route (e.g., "IV")

### JavaScript Integration:
- **Strength field** is populated from `drug.size` when a drug is selected
- **Route field** is set to `'IV'` by default for infusion medications
- **Both fields** are properly saved to the database when form is submitted

### Testing:
1. Select a drug from inventory → Strength and Route should populate
2. Save the form → Values should persist in database
3. Reopen the form → Values should load correctly

## Issue: Duplicate Previous Diagnoses Loading

**Problem:** The enhanced infusion form was loading previous diagnoses every time it was opened, causing duplicate entries in the diagnosis list.

**Root Cause:** The `loadPreviousDiagnoses()` function was being called unconditionally on every form load, regardless of whether it was a new or existing form.

**Solution:** Modified the JavaScript logic to only load previous diagnoses for new forms.

### Files Modified:
- `/var/www/emr.carepointinfusion.com/interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-inventory/integration/infusion_search_enhanced.php`

### Changes Made:
**Before (lines 1167-1168):**
```javascript
// Load previous diagnoses and medication
loadPreviousDiagnoses();
loadPreviousMedication();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Load previous diagnoses and medication only for new forms
const formIdInput = document.querySelector("input[name=\"id\"]");
if (!formIdInput) {
    loadPreviousDiagnoses();
}
loadPreviousMedication();
```

### Logic:
- **New forms** (no `id` field): Load previous diagnoses automatically
- **Existing forms** (has `id` field): Skip loading previous diagnoses to prevent duplicates

### Testing:
1. Open a NEW enhanced infusion form → Should see "Previous Diagnoses Loaded" message
2. Open the SAME form again → Should NOT see the message
3. Create a NEW form → Should see the message again (only once)

## Issue: Needle Gauge N/A Option

**Problem:** The Needle Gauge dropdown was missing an "N/A" option for cases like PICC lines where needle gauge isn't applicable.

**Solution:** Added "N/A" option to the Needle Gauge dropdown.

### Files Modified:
- `/var/www/emr.carepointinfusion.com/interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-inventory/integration/infusion_search_enhanced.php`

### Changes Made:
**Added to needle gauge dropdown:**
```html
<option value="N/A">N/A</option>
```

### Use Cases:
- **PICC lines** - No needle gauge required
- **Ports** - No needle gauge required
- **Other access devices** where needle gauge isn't applicable

## Database Schema Fixes

### Missing Column Issue
**Problem:** Form submission was failing with "Unknown column 'inventory_wastage_notes' in 'INSERT INTO'"

**Solution:** Added missing `inventory_wastage_notes` column to both infusion tables.

### SQL Commands Applied:
```sql
-- Add missing column to form_enhanced_infusion_injection
ALTER TABLE form_enhanced_infusion_injection 
ADD COLUMN inventory_wastage_notes text NULL AFTER inventory_wastage_reason;

-- Add missing column to form_infusion_injection  
ALTER TABLE form_infusion_injection 
ADD COLUMN inventory_wastage_notes text NULL AFTER inventory_wastage_reason;
```

### Files Updated:
- `fix_database_tables.sql` - Updated schema file with the missing column

## Inventory Module Fixes

### Database Connection Issues
**Problem:** Custom inventory module was failing due to session/authentication issues with OpenEMR globals.

**Solution:** Hardcoded database credentials in module files to bypass session issues.

### Files Modified:
- `search_all.php` - Fixed database connection and field mapping
- `search_all_fixed.php` - Fixed database connection and field mapping  
- `update-drug.php` - Fixed database connection
- `remove-drug.php` - Fixed database connection
- Various other module files

### Field Mapping Fixes:
**Before:**
```sql
ndc_number as barcode,
ndc_number as ndc_10,
ndc_number as ndc_11
```

**After:**
```sql
barcode,
ndc_10,
ndc_11
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Schema:** Run the updated `fix_database_tables.sql` on new installations
2. **Existing Installations:** Apply the ALTER TABLE commands for missing columns
3. **Module Files:** The hardcoded credentials are a temporary workaround - proper OpenEMR integration should be implemented in the future
4. **Form Logic:** The conditional diagnosis loading should be applied to all new installations
5. **Form Fields:** Ensure all form fields are properly mapped in save handlers

## Future Improvements

1. **Proper OpenEMR Integration:** Replace hardcoded credentials with proper OpenEMR session handling
2. **Form State Management:** Implement proper form state tracking to avoid duplicate loading
3. **Database Schema:** Consider adding indexes for better performance on large datasets
4. **Field Validation:** Add client-side and server-side validation for all form fields
