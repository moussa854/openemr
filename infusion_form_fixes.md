## Issue: Duplicate Previous Diagnoses Loading

**Problem:** The enhanced infusion form was loading previous diagnoses every time it was opened, causing duplicate entries in the diagnosis list.

**Root Cause:** The `loadPreviousDiagnoses()` function was being called unconditionally on every form load, regardless of whether it was a new or existing form.

**Solution:** Modified the JavaScript logic to only load previous diagnoses for new forms.

### Files Modified:
- `/var/www/emr.carepointinfusion.com/interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-inventory/integration/infusion_search_enhanced.php`

### Changes Made:
**Before (lines 1167-1168):**
```javascript
// Load previous diagnoses and medication
loadPreviousDiagnoses();
loadPreviousMedication();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Load previous diagnoses and medication only for new forms
const formIdInput = document.querySelector("input[name=\"id\"]");
if (!formIdInput) {
    loadPreviousDiagnoses();
}
loadPreviousMedication();
```

### Logic:
- **New forms** (no `id` field): Load previous diagnoses automatically
- **Existing forms** (has `id` field): Skip loading previous diagnoses to prevent duplicates

### Testing:
1. Open a NEW enhanced infusion form → Should see "Previous Diagnoses Loaded" message
2. Open the SAME form again → Should NOT see the message
3. Create a NEW form → Should see the message again (only once)

## Database Schema Fixes

### Missing Column Issue
**Problem:** Form submission was failing with "Unknown column 'inventory_wastage_notes' in 'INSERT INTO'"

**Solution:** Added missing `inventory_wastage_notes` column to both infusion tables.

### SQL Commands Applied:
```sql
-- Add missing column to form_enhanced_infusion_injection
ALTER TABLE form_enhanced_infusion_injection 
ADD COLUMN inventory_wastage_notes text NULL AFTER inventory_wastage_reason;

-- Add missing column to form_infusion_injection  
ALTER TABLE form_infusion_injection 
ADD COLUMN inventory_wastage_notes text NULL AFTER inventory_wastage_reason;
```

### Files Updated:
- `fix_database_tables.sql` - Updated schema file with the missing column

## Inventory Module Fixes

### Database Connection Issues
**Problem:** Custom inventory module was failing due to session/authentication issues with OpenEMR globals.

**Solution:** Hardcoded database credentials in module files to bypass session issues.

### Files Modified:
- `search_all.php` - Fixed database connection and field mapping
- `search_all_fixed.php` - Fixed database connection and field mapping  
- `update-drug.php` - Fixed database connection
- `remove-drug.php` - Fixed database connection
- Various other module files

### Field Mapping Fixes:
**Before:**
```sql
ndc_number as barcode,
ndc_number as ndc_10,
ndc_number as ndc_11
```

**After:**
```sql
barcode,
ndc_10,
ndc_11
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Schema:** Run the updated `fix_database_tables.sql` on new installations
2. **Existing Installations:** Apply the ALTER TABLE commands for missing columns
3. **Module Files:** The hardcoded credentials are a temporary workaround - proper OpenEMR integration should be implemented in the future
4. **Form Logic:** The conditional diagnosis loading should be applied to all new installations

## Future Improvements

1. **Proper OpenEMR Integration:** Replace hardcoded credentials with proper OpenEMR session handling
2. **Form State Management:** Implement proper form state tracking to avoid duplicate loading
3. **Database Schema:** Consider adding indexes for better performance on large datasets
