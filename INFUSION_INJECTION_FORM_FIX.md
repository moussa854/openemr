# Infusion Injection Form Display Issue - SOLUTION

## Problem
Your infusion_injection form is saving data to the database but not displaying in encounters. This is because **the form is not registered** in OpenEMR's form registry.

## Root Cause
OpenEMR requires forms to be:
1. **Registered** in the `registry` table
2. **Enabled** (state = 1)  
3. Have **database tables installed** (sql_run = 1)

Even though your form data saves correctly, it won't appear in encounters until it's properly registered.

## Solution

### Option 1: Manual Registration (Recommended)
1. **Access OpenEMR Admin Panel**:
   - Go to `Administration` → `Forms` → `Forms Administration`
   - Or navigate to: `/interface/forms_admin/forms_admin.php`

2. **Register the Form**:
   - Look for "Unregistered" section at the bottom
   - Find "Infusion and Injection Treatment Form" 
   - Click **"register"** link next to it

3. **Install Database Tables**:
   - After registration, form appears in "Registered" section
   - Click **"install DB"** link to install database tables
   - Form should now show "enabled" and "DB installed"

### Option 2: Programmatic Registration
Run the provided script `register_infusion_injection_form.php`:
```bash
php register_infusion_injection_form.php
```

## Technical Details

### What I Fixed
1. **Added Missing Function**: Created `infusion_injection_report()` function in `report.php`
2. **Proper Function Signature**: Used correct parameters `($pid, $encounter, $cols, $id, $print = true)`
3. **Form Display Logic**: Implemented proper table-based output similar to vitals form

### How OpenEMR Form Display Works
1. **Form Registration**: Forms must be in `registry` table with `state=1`
2. **Function Call**: OpenEMR calls `{formdir}_report()` function via `FormReportRenderer`
3. **Data Retrieval**: Function queries form table and formats output
4. **Display Integration**: Rendered in encounter view alongside other forms

### Registry Table Structure
```sql
SELECT * FROM registry WHERE directory = 'infusion_injection';
```
Should show:
- `state = 1` (enabled)
- `sql_run = 1` (tables installed)  
- `directory = 'infusion_injection'`
- `name = 'Infusion and Injection Treatment Form'`

## Files Modified
- `interface/forms/infusion_injection/report.php` - Added missing report function
- `register_infusion_injection_form.php` - Registration script (created)

## Verification
After registration, check:
1. Form appears in encounters after saving
2. Data displays properly in tabular format
3. No errors in browser console or OpenEMR logs

## Why This Happened
The form was created with:
- ✅ Database table (`form_infusion_injection`)
- ✅ Save functionality (`save.php`)
- ✅ Edit forms (`new.php`, `view.php`)
- ❌ **Missing**: Registry entry (required for encounter display)
- ❌ **Missing**: Proper report function (fixed)

## Next Steps
1. Register the form using Option 1 above
2. Test by creating a new encounter and adding the form
3. Save some data and verify it displays in the encounter summary
4. Clean up: Delete `register_infusion_injection_form.php` after use

The form should now work exactly like vital signs - appearing in encounters after being saved!
